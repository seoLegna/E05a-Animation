# E05a-Animation

It was really fun knowing how to use sprites properly,
its still a little fuzzy but my target this week is to create a 
full fleged game,
I know... I know, that is pretty ambitious but I think I can do it.

It was relly helpful to know how to make the program recive some 
real input, but again it is still a little fuzzy.

This was entertaing and knowledge bearing.
